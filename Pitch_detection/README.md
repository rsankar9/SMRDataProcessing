### Testing pitch detection using C and Python.

Given an annotated recording of a birdsong,
detect multiple renditions of a chosen syllable,
and compare their pitch.

In Python, the [numpy FFT pack](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/routines.fft.html) is used.

In C++, the [FFTW pack](http://www.fftw.org/) is used.
